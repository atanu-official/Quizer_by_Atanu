# Quizer_by_Atanu
A Quizer is a web app where users can create and take quizzes. Node.js handles the backend, storing questions and scores, while HTML, CSS, and JavaScript build an interactive frontend. Users can answer questions, get instant feedback, and navigate quizzes easily, making it a simple, responsive learning tool.
